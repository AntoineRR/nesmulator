# nesmulator

A simple Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) emulator written in Rust language.

The purpose of this emulator is for me to learn how the NES works and to challenge myself.
It is my first real project in Rust.

My goal is to be able to emulate games like Zelda I and II, Dragon Warrior, and Castlevania.

Only the CPU is emulated for now.
